title: "Performance Testing Baseline (Local Environment)"
summary: "This document captures the baseline performance characteristics of the Forge"
---

## Overview

This document captures the baseline performance characteristics of the Forge Platform under controlled local testing conditions. These results are not intended for publication. They serve as an internal reference point to:

- Validate system behavior under load
- Identify bottlenecks and instability
- Establish a benchmark before moving to AWS/ECS
- Inform future performance claims and comparisons

Raw k6 end-of-test output for this environment (baseline-mix, 50 VUs, 3 min warmup + 3 min load) is archived at [`local-jvm-baseline-mix-50vu-load3m-raw.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/get-forge/forge-docs/main/assets/performance/phase_1/local-jvm-baseline-mix-50vu-load3m-raw.txt).

## Executive Summary

With this interim test result, it is defensible to say the system supports:

“~50 concurrent active users generating ~50–55 RPS sustained in mixed workflow testing, with stable latency and no systemic failure.”

---

## Test Environment

### Runtime Topology

- Application runtime: Quarkus (JVM mode, dev servers)
- Test client: k6 (running locally)
- Infrastructure (local emulation):
  - DynamoDB -> LocalStack
  - PostgreSQL -> LocalStack
  - S3 -> LocalStack
- External dependency:
  - Cognito -> real AWS (`us-west-2`)

### Key Characteristics

- Mixed local + real cloud dependency model
- No network isolation (localhost execution)
- No containerization (yet)
- JVM warm-up behavior present
- Circuit breaker + timeout tuning applied during test iteration

---

## Test Configuration

```text
scenarios: 2 total
- warmup: 50 VUs for 1 minute
- load:   50 VUs for 3 minutes (steady state)
max VUs: 100
```

- Each run includes full test data cleanup beforehand
- Same scenario executed repeatedly for consistency
- Endpoint-level custom metrics enabled

---

## Summary of Results (Steady-State Runs)

Runs 3-5 represent stable system behavior after warm-up and tuning.

### Throughput

- Sustained: ~52-55 requests/sec
- Stable across runs

### Latency (aggregate)

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| p50 | ~9-12 ms |
| p95 | ~500-700 ms |
| p99 | ~1.0-1.1 s |

---

## Endpoint-Level Performance

### Actor Fetch (`endpoint_actor_get`)

- p50: ~7-9 ms
- p95: ~70-125 ms
- p99: ~130-425 ms

Interpretation:

- Fast and stable
- Minimal variance
- Represents core service performance

### Login (`endpoint_auth_login`)

- avg: ~400-450 ms
- p95: ~600-900 ms
- p99: ~700 ms-1 s

Interpretation:

- Dominated by external identity provider (Cognito)
- Stable latency profile
- Not an internal bottleneck

### Registration (`endpoint_auth_register`)

- avg: ~1.0 s
- p95: ~1.2-1.3 s
- p99: ~1.3-2.2 s

Interpretation:

- Heavier external operation (user creation)
- Stable after warm-up
- Occasional 400 errors due to test data collisions (acceptable)

### Document Upload (`endpoint_document_upload`)

- avg: ~130-175 ms
- p95: ~250-340 ms
- p99: ~400 ms-2 s

Interpretation:

- Initially unstable due to circuit breaker configuration
- Stabilized after tuning:
  - Timeout: `1000ms -> 5000ms`
  - Circuit breaker delay + thresholds adjusted
- Now predictable with bounded tail latency

---

## Observed System Behavior

### 1. Cold vs Warm State

Earlier runs (1-2) exhibited:

- Long tail latency (up to ~10s)
- Higher variability

After sustained execution (runs 3-5):

- Tail latency reduced significantly
- System stabilized

Conclusion: Warm-up phase alone is insufficient; system requires extended load to reach steady state.

### 2. Tail Latency Drivers

Primary contributors:

- External dependency (Cognito)
- Document upload path (now mitigated)
- Initial circuit breaker sensitivity

### 3. Failure Analysis

#### Registration Failures

- Cause: duplicate user creation (Cognito)
- Frequency: extremely low (~0.01%)
- Status: acceptable, realistic

#### Document Upload Failures (Run 4)

- Cause: circuit breaker half-open state
- Resolution: configuration tuning
- Status: resolved and reproducible

---

## Key Insights

### Fast Core, Slower Edges

- Internal services respond in single-digit milliseconds
- End-to-end latency is driven by external systems

### Stability Achieved Through Tuning

- Circuit breaker configuration had a material impact
- Proper thresholds eliminated instability

### Repeatability Established

- Runs 3-5 show consistent, predictable behavior
- Variance is understood and explainable

---

## Internal Positioning Statement

The platform demonstrates stable, repeatable performance under sustained load with predictable latency characteristics. Internal services respond in single-digit milliseconds, while end-to-end latency is dominated by external dependencies such as identity providers.

---

## Limitations of This Test

- Localhost execution (no real network conditions)
- LocalStack does not fully replicate AWS performance characteristics
- No container orchestration (ECS not yet introduced)
- No load balancer layer
- JVM mode only (no native image comparison yet)

---

## Next Steps

### Move to AWS ECS

- Deploy services as ECS tasks
- Introduce ALB
- Run load tests from EC2 (same region)

### Validate Horizontal Scaling

- 1 -> 2 -> 5+ tasks
- Measure scaling efficiency
- Track latency distribution changes

### Optional Enhancements

- JVM vs native image comparison
- Per-endpoint isolated scenarios
- Extended soak testing

## Appendix: Selected Run Data

### Run 3 (Representative Stable Run)

http_req_duration:
  p50: 11.11ms
  p95: 513.29ms
  p99: 1.04s

```

### Run 4 (Circuit Breaker Event)

```text

Cause: circuit breaker half-open state
Resolution: increased timeout + adjusted thresholds
```

### Run 5 (Post-Tuning Stability)

```text
Throughput: 53.5 req/s
http_req_duration:
  p50: 12.14ms
  p95: 672.74ms
  p99: 1.1s
  max: 4s

```

## Conclusion

The system is now in a stable, well-understood state suitable for:

- Migration to AWS infrastructure
- Horizontal scaling validation
- Generation of publishable performance data

No critical performance or reliability concerns remain at this stage.
