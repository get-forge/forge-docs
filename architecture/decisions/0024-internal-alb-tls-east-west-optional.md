# **ADR-0024: Internal (private) ALB TLS for east-west traffic (optional)**

**Date:** 2026-04-07  
**Status:** Accepted  

---

## **Context**

The runtime uses an **internal-facing Application Load Balancer** in **private subnets** for
**service-to-service** and **browser-to-API** paths that are routed by hostname and path rules (see
`INTERNAL_ALB_PATH_SERVICES`, `addInternalAlbListener`, ADR-0020). Traffic stays **inside the VPC** between
**Fargate** tasks and the internal ALB.

**TLS on the public ALB** is **required** for browser-facing HTTPS and is **implemented** (ACM certificate,
HTTPS listener, HTTP to HTTPS redirect). That work establishes a **repeatable pattern**: ACM in the same region
as the ALB, listeners, and task **client** configuration using the **correct scheme** (for example **CORS**
`Origin` matching **https** for the public hostname).

**TLS on the internal ALB** adds **encryption in transit** for **east-west** hops and raises the bar against
**passive** observation or trivial **in-VPC** manipulation of cleartext. It does **not** replace **service
authentication**, **stateless** tokens, or **least-privilege IAM**; those controls prove **who** is calling.
**Defense in depth** combines **identity** with **confidentiality** on the wire.

**Operational reality:** not every deployment has **strict PII**, **regulated** workloads, or organizational
mandates for **encrypt everything** inside the VPC. Internal HTTP behind **security groups** and **private**
subnets is a **common** AWS pattern. Rolling out internal **HTTPS** on the **listener** is **incremental** once
public TLS is understood: ACM-issued certificate for a resolvable internal hostname, or a private CA-issued
certificate where required, **443** listener on the internal ALB, **security group** ingress on **443**, and
**https://** base URLs in **REST clients** and health checks where applicable. That still leaves the **ALB →
target** hop as a **separate** decision (see below).

---

## **ALB TLS termination and the hop to targets**

**Application Load Balancers** terminate **TLS** on the **listener** when you use an **HTTPS** listener. Traffic
from the load balancer to **registered targets** uses whatever **protocol** the **target group** is configured
for.

**Baseline Forge CDK** (see `ForgeElbTargetGroupConstruct`): **all** application target groups use
**`protocol: HTTP`** to **ECS tasks** on the **container port** (for example **8080**). The **public** ALB uses
an **HTTPS** listener toward clients and **forwards** to those **HTTP** target groups. So today:

| Segment | Encrypted in baseline? |
|--------|-------------------------|
| **Client → public ALB** | **Yes** (HTTPS listener, ACM on the ALB). |
| **Public ALB → ECS task** | **No** (HTTP target group within the VPC). |
| **Task → internal ALB → task** | **No** (HTTP throughout). |

**Implication:** Turning on an **HTTPS** listener on the **internal** ALB encrypts **caller → internal ALB**
only. It does **not**, by itself, encrypt **internal ALB → Fargate**. **Full** encryption on that last hop
requires **HTTPS target groups** (and tasks serving **TLS**, with certificate trust and health checks aligned),
or a **service mesh** / **mTLS** pattern (for example **AWS App Mesh**, **Istio**), or other designs **outside**
the baseline ADR.

This ADR avoids implying that **listener-only HTTPS** equals **end-to-end** encryption to the task. Reviewers and
customer teams should treat **infrastructure observation** between ALB and task as **out of scope** for listener
TLS alone.

---

## **Decision**

1. **Baseline CDK keeps the internal ALB on HTTP (port 80)** for listeners between tasks and the internal ALB.
   This matches the **current** `addInternalAlbListener` shape and **FORGE_INTERNAL_ALB_URL** usage (`http://` to
   the internal ALB DNS name).

2. **HTTPS on the internal ALB is optional** and **customer-owned** when **compliance**, **threat model**, or
   **policy** require **east-west** encryption. Teams may adopt it by **following the same TLS pattern** already
   proven on the **public** ALB (certificate, listeners, clients, and **scheme-correct** configuration such as
   CORS or callback URLs where relevant).

3. **No requirement** that every Forge deployment enable internal TLS. The **reference** implementation
   **demonstrates** public-edge TLS; **internal** TLS remains an **extension** for clients who need it.

## **Guidance: when internal HTTP is acceptable vs when to prefer internal HTTPS**

The baseline choice is **deliberately** HTTP on the internal ALB. The following thresholds make **when to stay**
on that posture vs **when to add** internal TLS explicit for **security reviewers** and **customer teams**. They
do **not** change the **Decision**: CDK still ships HTTP internally until a team opts in.

**Internal HTTP on the private ALB is a reasonable posture when** (all are generally true for the deployment):

- Payloads are **non-sensitive** or sensitivity is **low** (no material **PII**, **secrets**, or **long-lived
  tokens** on these hops).
- Workloads are **single-tenant** or **tightly scoped** (limited blast radius if a task is compromised).
- The **threat model** does **not** assume an **in-VPC** adversary who can passively capture or alter east-west
  traffic (for example no requirement to defend against sniffing inside the VPC boundary).
- **Compliance** obligations do **not** mandate **encryption in transit** for east-west segments.

**Internal HTTPS (or mTLS) on the private ALB is strongly recommended when** **any** of the following apply:

- Requests or responses carry **PII**, **credentials**, **bearer tokens** (for example **JWTs**, access tokens),
  or other **confidential** payload data across the internal ALB.
- **Multi-tenant** workloads or **shared AWS accounts** widen **blast radius** or co-mingle trust boundaries.
- **Compliance** or customer policy expects **encryption in transit** end-to-end (for example **SOC 2**,
  **HIPAA**, or equivalent regimes; exact scope is **customer** legal interpretation).
- The organization assumes **workload compromise** is plausible and wants **defense in depth** against
  **passive** collection or trivial tampering **on the wire** inside the VPC (internal TLS raises the bar; it
  does **not** remove the need for **authn** and **authz**).

**Customer-owned action:** teams that hit the **strongly recommended** row should plan **HTTPS** (or **mTLS**)
on the internal **listener** using the **same certificate and listener pattern** as the public ALB, plus
**https://** internal base URLs for REST clients and any health checks that target that listener. If **policy**
requires **encryption all the way to the task**, they must also plan **HTTPS target groups** (and **TLS** on the
application) or **mesh** / **mTLS**, as described in **ALB TLS termination and the hop to targets** above.

---

## **Consequences**

- **Positive:** Simpler **baseline** operations (single scheme for internal URLs, no extra cert lifecycle for
  the internal hostname unless needed); **flexibility** for customers with different **compliance** bars;
  **clear** separation between **internet** risk (must encrypt) and **VPC** risk (policy-driven).

- **Explicit gap:** **Baseline** east-west traffic to the internal ALB is **not** TLS-protected. See **Guidance**
  above for **when** that is acceptable vs **when** customer teams should treat internal **HTTPS** (or **mTLS**)
  as **expected**, not optional.

- **Listener TLS alone:** Even the **public** ALB does **not** use **HTTPS** to targets in baseline; **ALB →
  task** is **HTTP**. Internal listener HTTPS would mirror that split. Do **not** equate **ALB HTTPS** with
  **end-to-end** encryption to **ECS** without **target group** and **application** changes (or mesh). See **ALB
  TLS termination and the hop to targets**.

- **Security posture:** **Zero-trust** service authentication and **stateless** conversations remain
  **authoritative** for **caller identity**; internal TLS is an **additional** layer for **payload** protection
  on the **network path**, not a substitute for **authn** or **authz**.
